       <p>Chinese Acupuncture for Health and Fertility in CBD, Docklands, Westmeadows and surrounding areas
<br />
<br /> Considered to be one of the most popular in the natural treatments healthcare sector, acupuncture has been shown to treat
patients who are afflicted with a wide range of conditions. This is already found to be a thriving approach to healthcare
as patients are given a holistic and organic alternative to the treatment of disease and illness, linking body, mind and
emotions.
<br />
<br /> Our doctors can help you achieve complete physical health and mental wellbeing with professional and tailored care. We
understand what makes a body function correctly, and are able to restore any body back to its normal state and optimum
wellbeing, correcting imbalances and removing toxicities and imperfections. Using effective needling techniques, we target
the central nervous system – the brain and spinal cord – which is responsible for cognition, emotions and fluid movement.
Broadly, our Chinese acupuncture targets the large muscle and bone groups; on a smaller scale, we restore the neurons
to proper health.
<br />
<br /> Secure and safe fertility acupuncture Traditional Chinese needling is an effective means of restoring the body to its
peak condition, providing the perfect internal conditions for fertility and reproduction. Our family planning treatments
create balance in the body using a lifestyle plan, raising endorphin levels and reducing stress for pre- and post-natal
happiness, as well as health during your pregnancy.
<br />
<br /> Acupuncture involves the insertion of fine, sterile needles into specific sites along the body&rsquo;s meridians to clear energy
blockages and to encourage the normal flow of qi through the individual. The practitioner stimulates the points using
other methods: cupping, laser therapy, electro-stimulation and massage, to provide a holistic, effective therapy. We also
use stimulation, and needle-free ultrasound.
<br />
<br /> Like our generalised acupuncturist service, our fertility acupuncture specialisation combines the traditional needling
with herbal and traditional medicine, lifestyle plan and specialised dietary requirements for optimum prenatal health.
